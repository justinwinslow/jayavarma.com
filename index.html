			<h2>Hello!</h2>

			<p>My name is Jaya Varma and I am a violinist currently working in the greater Miami area.<p>

			<p>After receiving my Master's degree from the University of Michigan where I studied with the amazing Yehonatan Berick, I spent two years as a freelance violinist and educator in Boston. During that time I served as Resident Artist for the acclaimed <a href="http://elsistemausa.org/" target="_blank" class="externalLink">el sistema program</a> at the <a href="http://conservatorylab.org/" target="_blank" class="externalLink">Conservatory Lab Charter School</a> in Brighton, MA.  If you are at all interested in the arts in schools you need to check out this school!  The program is one of a kind and I will never forget the beautiful kids and teachers I worked with there. Additionally, I taught Suzuki violin at the All Newton Music School. As a performer, I served as concertmaster for the <a href="http://www.brooklinesymphony.org/" target="_blank" class="externalLink">Brookline Symphony</a> and played regularly with the world class chamber orchestra, <a href="http://discoveryensemble.com/" target="_blank" class="externalLink">Discovery Ensemble</a>. </p>

			<p>If you are looking for strings for your Miami-area wedding or event, please visit the section on <a href="#events" class="internalLink">weddings and events</a>. I know you will find the information helpful as you put together the details for your special occasion!</p>

			<p>You can also get in touch with me any time using the <a href="#contact" class="internalLink">contact form</a> at the bottom of the page.</p>

			<h2>Teaching</h2>

			<p>Teaching in Boston really gave me some perspective on the state of music education and what it takes to mold an energetic kid into a musician. The experience has made me an outstanding group and private teacher.</p>

			<p>There are many pedagogical ideas and methods out there.  While I primarily use the Suzuki method for beginners, I firmly believe in the development of a complete musician.  This involves incorporating ideas and exercises from a variety of sources depending on the needs of the individual.</p>

			<p>It's never too late to start playing a string instrument!  I have experience teaching students from ages 3-65 and have enjoyed the unique challenges teaching provides.  If you are seeking private violin or viola lessons in the Miami and Miami Beach area, please contact me here for studio policies, pricing, and other information.</p>

			<h2>Book your Event</h2>

			<p>A string quartet, trio, duet, or soloist can be an elegant addition to your special occasion.  A string ensemble can easily be contracted to play for your wedding or event.  Over the years, I have performed in countless weddings and have a lot of experience working with couples to create the perfect mood for their special day.</p>

			<p>You can be assured that when you book musicians through me, you are booking professional, experienced musicians with conservatory level training.</p>

			<h2>Studio Recording</h2>

			<p>Over the years, I've been involved in several non-classical recording projects.  I love getting the opportunity to explore other genres and collaborate with new people. I am an extremely versatile player and have played in a folk band, with jazz musicians, and even some hip-hop! I've recorded in Pennsylvania, Boston, Rhode Island, and Atlanta with some really fabulous musicians and engineers.  Contact me if you're looking for a violinist for your next recording projectâ€¦I can play anything you put in front of me!  References available upon request.</p>
